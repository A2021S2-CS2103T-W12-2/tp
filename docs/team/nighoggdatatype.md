## Contribution

This is the [code](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=nighoggDatatype&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-02-19&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=nighoggDatatype&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2103T-W12-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false) I contributed.

- Besides the code, my main contribution was the strict review of many of my teammates PR's, which helped improve the
  general quality of the code base.

- I also implemented some Filters like NameFilter, CoeExpiryFilter, and did the initial implementation for a typo
  tolerant NameFilter, although that eventually was replaced by a subsequence algorithm.

- I wrote down a very complete test class for CoeExpiryFilter, and improved the test code for `DateOfBirthTest.java`.
  This was in fact, part of a moderate effort at code improvement I did near the end.

- In the UG, I wrote down some clarifying documentation on the COE Expiry Filter, and other filters.
