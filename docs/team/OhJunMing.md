## Project: Car@leads


# Welcome to Car@leads
Car@leads is a **desktop app for a car salesperson to manage customer contacts** (CLI).
<br> Users can add new customer contacts which include details such as customer's car brand and car type preferences along with other personal information.
<br> Users can filter through the customer data using specific filters, such as filtering out customers who prefer a specific car brand and follow up with them for sales opportunities.
<br> The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 17 kLoC.
