#Welcome to Car@leads
Car@leads is a **desktop app for a car salesperson to manage customer contacts** (CLI).
<br> Users can add new customer contacts which include details such as customer's car brand and car type preferences along with other personal information.
<br> Users can filter through the customer data using specific filters, such as filtering out customers who prefer a specific car brand and follow up with them for sales opportunities.
<br> Car@leads is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface, while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
<br> If you can type fast, Car@leads can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* `COE_EXPIRY_DATE` input order: YYYY{space}MM{space}DD
  * Example: `2013 12 31`
  * This is the same input format as `DATE_OF_BIRTH`
* `|` joins car with COE expiry date
* `+` joins car brand and car type

**IMP** : All arguments are optional. In particular:
- for `c/OWNED_CARBRAND+OWNED_CARTYPE`, user can either give brand or type information, or both using the `+`sign to 
  separate.
  
- for `cp/PREFERRED_CARBRAND+PREFERRED_CARTYPE` user can either give brand or type information, or both using the 
  `+` sign to separate.
  
- for `n/NAME` giving a partial name is also okay - all names which have the given parameter as a subsequence (Note 
  that `abc` is a subsequence of `addbddc`) will be matched. Note that this is the only field for which we match 
  a subsequence instead of a simple substring.
  
- for `e/EMAIL`, all email containing the given parameter will be valid, but note that domain name is not checked.
    - eg `find e/abc` will return profiles with the following emails:
        -  `abcd@gmail.com`
        -  `bbabc@gmail.com`
    - It will _not_ return:
        - `xxx@abc.com`
        - `axbyc@hhh.com`


Further details about the search options are as follows:

- For `coe/COE_EXPIRY_DATE`, using `coe/exp` will search for all customers with an expired COE on any of the cars they own.
  it is a special case alias for the search `coe/0`, where `coe/NON_NEGATIVE_NUMBER` will search for any customers with
  at least one car that will expire in `NON_NEGATIVE_NUMBER` years *or less*.
